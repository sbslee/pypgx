Introduction
============

The main purpose of the PyPGx package is to provide a unified platform for
pharmacogenomics (PGx) research. PyPGx is and always will be completely free
and open source.

The package is written in Python, and supports both command line interface
(CLI) and application programming interface (API) whose documentations are
available at the `Read the Docs <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

PyPGx can predict PGx genotypes (e.g. ``*4/*5``) and phenotypes (e.g.
``Poor Metabolizer``) using various genomic data, including data from
next-generation sequencing (NGS), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array,
and long-read sequencing. Importantly, for NGS data the package can detect
`structural variation (SV) <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
glossary.html#structural-variation-sv>`__ using a machine learning-based
approach. Finally, note that PyPGx is compatible with both of the Genome
Reference Consortium Human (GRCh) builds, GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh38 (hg38).

There are currently 59 pharmacogenes in PyPGx:

Installation
============

Following packages are required to run PyPGx:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Package
     - Anaconda
     - PyPI
   * - ``fuc``
     - ✅
     - ✅
   * - ``scikit-learn``
     - ✅
     - ✅
   * - ``openjdk``
     - ✅
     - ❌

There are various ways you can install PyPGx. The recommended way is via
conda (`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`__):

.. code-block:: text

   $ conda install -c bioconda pypgx

Above will automatically download and install all the dependencies as well.
Alternatively, you can use pip (`PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`__) to install
PyPGx and all of its dependencies except ``openjdk`` (i.e. Java JDK must be
installed separately):

.. code-block:: text

   $ pip install pypgx

Finally, you can clone the GitHub repository and then install PyPGx locally:

.. code-block:: text

   $ git clone https://github.com/sbslee/pypgx
   $ cd pypgx
   $ pip install .

The nice thing about this approach is that you will have access to
development versions that are not available in Anaconda or PyPI. For example,
you can access a development branch with the ``git checkout`` command. When
you do this, please make sure your environment already has all the
dependencies installed.

.. warning::
    You're not done yet! Keep scrolling down to obtain the resource bundle
    for PyPGx, which is essential for running the package.

Resource bundle
===============

Starting with the 0.12.0 version, reference haplotype panel files and
structural variant classifier files in PyPGx are moved to the
``pypgx-bundle`` `repository <https://github.com/sbslee/pypgx-bundle>`__
(only those files are moved; other files such as ``allele-table.csv`` and
``variant-table.csv`` are intact). Therefore, the user must clone the
``pypgx-bundle`` repository with matching PyPGx version to their home
directory in order for PyPGx to correctly access the moved files:

.. code-block:: text

   $ cd ~
   $ git clone --branch 0.12.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/sbslee/pypgx-bundle

This is undoubtedly annoying, but absolutely necessary for portability
reasons because PyPGx has been growing exponentially in file size due to the
increasing number of genes supported and their variation complexity, to the
point where it now exceeds upload size limit for PyPI (100 Mb). After removal
of those files, the size of PyPGx has reduced from >100 Mb to <1 Mb.

Structural variation detection
==============================

Many pharmacogenes are known to have `structural variation (SV)
<https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#structural-variation-
sv>`__ such as gene deletions, duplications, and hybrids. You can visit the
`Genes <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genes.html>`__ page to see the
list of genes with SV.

Some of the SV events can be quite challenging to detect accurately with NGS
data due to misalignment of sequence reads caused by sequence homology with
other gene family members (e.g. CYP2D6 and CYP2D7). PyPGx attempts to address
this issue by training a `support vector machine (SVM) <https://scikit-
learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html>`__-based multiclass
classifier using the `one-vs-rest strategy <https://scikit-learn.org/stable
/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.html>`__ for each
gene for each GRCh build. Each classifier is trained using copy number
profiles of real NGS samples as well as simulated ones, including those from
`1KGP <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#genomes-project-
1kgp>`__ and `GeT-RM <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
glossary.html#genetic-testing-reference-materials-coordination-program-get-rm>`__.

You can plot copy number profile and allele fraction profile with PyPGx to
visually inspect SV calls. Below are CYP2D6 examples:

GRCh37 vs. GRCh38
=================

When working with PGx data, it's not uncommon to encounter a situation
where you are handling GRCh37 data in one project but GRCh38 in another. You
may be tempted to use tools like ``LiftOver`` to convert GRCh37 to GRCh38, or
vice versa, but deep down you know it's going to be a mess (and please don't
do this). The good news is, PyPGx supports both of the builds!

In many PyPGx actions, you can simply indicate which genome build to use. For
example, for GRCh38 data you can use ``--assembly GRCh38`` in CLI and
``assembly='GRCh38'`` in API. **Note that GRCh37 will always be the
default.** Below is an example of using the API:

.. code:: python3

    >>> import pypgx
    >>> pypgx.list_variants('CYP2D6', alleles=['*4'], assembly='GRCh37')
    ['22-42524947-C-T']
    >>> pypgx.list_variants('CYP2D6', alleles=['*4'], assembly='GRCh38')
    ['22-42128945-C-T']

However, there is one important caveat to consider if your sequencing data is
GRCh38. That is, sequence reads must be aligned only to the main contigs
(i.e. ``chr1``, ``chr2``, ..., ``chrX``, ``chrY``), and not to the
alternative (ALT) contigs such as ``chr1_KI270762v1_alt``. This is because
the presence of ALT contigs reduces the sensitivity of variant calling
and many other analyses including SV detection. Therefore, if you have
sequencing data in GRCh38, make sure it's aligned to the main contigs only.

The only exception to above rule is the GSTT1 gene, which is located on
``chr22`` for GRCh37 but on ``chr22_KI270879v1_alt`` for GRCh38. This gene is
known to have an extremely high rate of gene deletion polymorphism in the
population and thus requires SV analysis. Therefore, if you are interested in
genotyping this gene with GRCh38 data, then you must include that contig
when performing read alignment. To this end, you can easily filter your
reference FASTA file before read alignment so that it only contains the main
contigs plus the ALT contig. If you don't know how to do this, here's one way
using the ``fuc`` program (which should have already been installed along
with PyPGx):

.. code-block:: text

    $ cat contigs.list
    chr1
    chr2
    ...
    chrX
    chrY
    chr22_KI270879v1_alt
    $ fuc fa-filter in.fa --contigs contigs.list > out.fa

Archive file, semantic type, and metadata
=========================================

In order to efficiently store and transfer data, PyPGx uses the ZIP archive
file format (``.zip``) which supports lossless data compression. Each archive
file created by PyPGx has a metadata file (``metadata.txt``) and a data file
(e.g. ``data.tsv``, ``data.vcf``). A metadata file contains important
information about the data file within the same archive, which is expressed
as pairs of ``=``-separated keys and values (e.g. ``Assembly=GRCh37``):

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 40 40
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Metadata
      - Description
      - Examples
    * - ``Assembly``
      - Reference genome assembly.
      - ``GRCh37``, ``GRCh38``

    * - ``Platform``
      - Genotyping platform.
      - ``WGS``, ``Targeted``, ``Chip``, ``LongRead``
    * - ``Program``

    * - ``SemanticType``
      - Semantic type of the archive.
      - ``CovFrame[CopyNumber]``, ``Model[CNV]``

Semantic types
--------------

Notably, all archive files have defined semantic types, which allows us to
ensure that the data that is passed to a PyPGx command (CLI) or method (API)
is meaningful for the operation that will be performed. Below is a list of
currently defined semantic types:

- ``CovFrame[CopyNumber]``
    * CovFrame for storing target gene's per-base copy number which is computed from read depth with control statistics.
    * Requires following metadata: ``Gene``, ``Assembly``, ``SemanticType``, ``Platform``, ``Control``, ``Samples``.

Working with archive files
--------------------------

To demonstrate how easy it is to work with PyPGx archive files, below we will
show some examples. First, download an archive to play with, which has
``SampleTable[Results]`` as semantic type:

.. code-block:: text

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbslee/pypgx-data/main/getrm-wgs-tutorial/grch37-CYP2D6-results.zip

Let's print its metadata:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pypgx print-metadata grch37-CYP2D6-results.zip
    Gene=CYP2D6
    Assembly=GRCh37
    SemanticType=SampleTable[Results]

Now print its main data (but display first sample only):

.. code-block:: text

    $ pypgx print-data grch37-CYP2D6-results.zip | head -n 2
    	Genotype	Phenotype	Haplotype1	Haplotype2	AlternativePhase	VariantData	CNV
    HG00276_PyPGx	*4/*5	Poor Metabolizer	*4;*10;*74;*2;	*10;*74;*2;	;	*4:22-42524947-C-T:0.913;*10:22-42526694-G-A,22-42523943-A-G:1.0,1.0;*74:22-42525821-G-T:1.0;*2:default;	DeletionHet

We can unzip it to extract files inside (note that ``tmpcty4c_cr`` is the
original folder name):

.. code-block:: text

    $ unzip grch37-CYP2D6-results.zip
    Archive:  grch37-CYP2D6-results.zip
      inflating: tmpcty4c_cr/metadata.txt
      inflating: tmpcty4c_cr/data.tsv

We can now directly interact with the files:

.. code-block:: text

    $ cat tmpcty4c_cr/metadata.txt
    Gene=CYP2D6
    Assembly=GRCh37
    SemanticType=SampleTable[Results]
    $ head -n 2 tmpcty4c_cr/data.tsv
    	Genotype	Phenotype	Haplotype1	Haplotype2	AlternativePhase	VariantData	CNV
    HG00276_PyPGx	*4/*5	Poor Metabolizer	*4;*10;*74;*2;	*10;*74;*2;	;	*4:22-42524947-C-T:0.913;*10:22-42526694-G-A,22-42523943-A-G:1.0,1.0;*74:22-42525821-G-T:1.0;*2:default;	DeletionHet

We can easily create a new archive:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zip -r grch37-CYP2D6-results-new.zip tmpcty4c_cr
      adding: tmpcty4c_cr/ (stored 0%)
      adding: tmpcty4c_cr/metadata.txt (stored 0%)
      adding: tmpcty4c_cr/data.tsv (deflated 84%)
    $ pypgx print-metadata grch37-CYP2D6-results-new.zip
    Gene=CYP2D6
    Assembly=GRCh37
    SemanticType=SampleTable[Results]

Phenotype prediction
====================

Many genes in PyPGx have a genotype-phenotype table available from the
Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) or
the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB). PyPGx uses these tables to
perform phenotype prediction with one of the two methods:

- Method 1. Simple diplotype-phenotype mapping: This method directly uses the
  diplotype-phenotype mapping as defined by CPIC or PharmGKB. Using the
  CYP2B6 gene as an example, the diplotypes \*6/\*6, \*1/\*29, \*1/\*2,
  \*1/\*4, and \*4/\*4 correspond to Poor Metabolizer, Intermediate
  Metabolizer, Normal Metabolizer, Rapid Metabolizer, and Ultrarapid
  Metabolizer.
- Method 2. Summation of haplotype activity scores: This method uses a
  standard unit of enzyme activity known as an activity score. Using the
  CYP2D6 gene as an example, the fully functional reference \*1 allele is
  assigned a value of 1, decreased-function alleles such as \*9 and \*17
  receive a value of 0.5, and nonfunctional alleles including \*4 and \*5
  have a value of 0. The sum of values assigned to both alleles constitutes
  the activity score of a diplotype. Consequently, subjects with \*1/\*1,
  \*1/\*4, and \*4/\*5 diplotypes have an activity score of 2 (Normal
  Metabolizer), 1 (Intermediate Metabolizer), and 0 (Poor Metabolizer),
  respectively.

Please visit the `Genes <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
genes.html>`__ page to see the list of genes with a genotype-phenotype
table and each of their prediction method.

To perform phenotype prediction with the API, you can use the
``pypgx.predict_phenotype`` method:

.. code:: python3

    >>> import pypgx
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*4', '*5')   # Both alleles have no function
    'Poor Metabolizer'
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*5', '*4')   # The order of alleles does not matter
    'Poor Metabolizer'
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*1', '*22')  # *22 has uncertain function
    'Indeterminate'
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*1', '*1x2') # Gene duplication
    'Ultrarapid Metabolizer'

To perform phenotype prediction with the CLI, you can use the
``call-phenotypes`` command. It takes a ``SampleTable[Genotypes]`` file as
input and outputs a ``SampleTable[Phenotypes]`` file:

.. code-block:: text

   $ pypgx call-phenotypes genotypes.zip phenotypes.zip

Pipelines
=========

PyPGx currently provides three pipelines for performing PGx genotype analysis
of single gene for one or multiple samples: NGS pipeline, chip pipeline, and
long-read pipeline. In additional to genotyping, each pipeline will perform
phenotype prediction based on genotype results. All pipelines are compatible
with both GRCh37 and GRCh38 (e.g. for GRCh38 use ``--assembly GRCh38`` in CLI
and ``assembly='GRCh38'`` in API).

NGS pipeline
------------

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbslee/pypgx-data/main/flowchart-ngs-pipeline.png

Implemented as ``pypgx run-ngs-pipeline`` in CLI and
``pypgx.pipeline.run_ngs_pipeline`` in API, this pipeline is designed for
processing short-read data (e.g. Illumina). Users must specify whether the
input data is from whole genome sequencing (WGS) or targeted sequencing
(custome targeted panel sequencing or whole exome sequencing).

This pipeline supports SV detection based on copy number analysis for genes
that are known to have SV. Therefore, if the target gene is associated with
SV (e.g. CYP2D6) it's strongly recommended to provide a
``CovFrame[DepthOfCoverage]`` file and a ``SampleTable[Statistics]`` file in
addtion to a VCF file containing SNVs/indels. If the target gene is not
associated with SV (e.g. CYP3A5) providing a VCF file alone is enough. You can
visit the `Genes <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genes.html>`__ page
to see the full list of genes with SV. For details on SV detection algorithm,
please see the `Structural variation detection <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/
en/latest/readme.html#structural-variation-detection>`__ section.

When creating a VCF file (containing SNVs/indels) from BAM files, users have
a choice to either use the ``pypgx create-input-vcf`` command (strongly
recommended) or a variant caller of their choice (e.g. GATK4
HaplotypeCaller). See the `Variant caller choice <https://pypgx.readthedocs.
io/en/latest/faq.html#variant-caller-choice>`__ section for detailed
discussion on when to use either option.

Check out the `GeT-RM WGS tutorial <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
tutorials.html#get-rm-wgs-tutorial>`__ to see this pipeline in action.

Chip pipeline
-------------

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbslee/pypgx-data/main/flowchart-chip-pipeline.png

Implemented as ``pypgx run-chip-pipeline`` in CLI and
``pypgx.pipeline.run_chip_pipeline`` in API, this pipeline is designed for
DNA chip data (e.g. Global Screening Array from Illumina). It's recommended
to perform variant imputation on the input VCF prior to feeding it to the
pipeline using a large reference haplotype panel (e.g. `TOPMed Imputation
Server <https://imputation.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/>`__).
Alternatively, it's possible to perform variant imputation with the 1000
Genomes Project (1KGP) data as reference within PyPGx using ``--impute`` in
CLI and ``impute=True`` in API.

The pipeline currently does not support SV detection. Please post a GitHub
issue if you want to contribute your development skills and/or data for
devising an SV detection algorithm.

Check out the `Coriell Affy tutorial <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
tutorials.html#coriell-affy-tutorial>`__ to see this pipeline in action.

Long-read pipeline
------------------

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbslee/pypgx-data/main/flowchart-long-read-pipeline.png

Implemented as ``pypgx run-long-read-pipeline`` in CLI and
``pypgx.pipeline.run_long_read_pipeline`` in API, this pipeline is designed
for long-read data (e.g. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore
Technologies). The input VCF must be phased using a read-backed haplotype
phasing tool such as `WhatsHap <https://github.com/whatshap/whatshap>`__.

The pipeline currently does not support SV detection. Please post a GitHub
issue if you want to contribute your development skills and/or data for
devising an SV detection algorithm.

Results interpretation
======================

PyPGx outputs per-sample genotype results in a table, which is stored in an
archive file with the semantic type ``SampleTable[Results]``. Below, we will
use the CYP2D6 gene with GRCh37 as an example to illustrate how to interpret
genotype results from PyPGx.

     - Duplication

This list explains each of the columns in the example results.

- **Genotype**: Diplotype call. This simply combines the two top-ranked star alleles from **Haplotype1** and **Haplotype2** with '/'.
- **Phenotype**: Phenotype call.
- **Haplotype1**, **Haplotype2**: List of candidate star alleles for each haplotype. For example, if a given haplotype contains three variants 22-42523943-A-G, 22-42524947-C-T, and 22-42526694-G-A, then it will get assigned ``*4;*10;`` because the haplotype pattern can fit both \*4 (22-42524947-C-T) and \*10 (22-42523943-A-G and 22-42526694-G-A). Note that \*4 comes first before \*10 because it has higher priority for reporting purposes (see the ``pypgx.sort_alleles`` `method <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pypgx.api.core.sort_alleles>`__ for detailed implementation).
- **AlternativePhase**: List of star alleles that could be missed due to potentially incorrect statistical phasing. For example, let's assume that statistical phasing has put 22-42526694-G-A for **Haplotype1** and 22-42523805-C-T for **Haplotype2**. Even though the two variants are in trans orientation, PyPGx will also consider alternative phase in case the two variants are actually in cis orientation, resulting in ``*69;`` as **AlternativePhase** because \*69 is defined by 22-42526694-G-A and 22-42523805-C-T.
- **VariantData**: Information for SNVs/indels used to define observed star alleles, including allele fraction which is important for allelic decomposition after identifying CNV (e.g. the sample NA19207). In some situations, there will not be any variants for a given star allele because the allele itself is "default" allele for the selected reference assembly (e.g. GRCh37 has \*2 as default while GRCh38 has \*1).
- **CNV**: Structural variation call. See the `Structural variation detection <https://pypgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#structural-variation-detection>`__ section for more details.

CLI examples
============

We can print the metadata of an archive file:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pypgx print-metadata grch37-depth-of-coverage.zip

Above will print:

.. code-block:: text

    Assembly=GRCh37
    SemanticType=CovFrame[DepthOfCoverage]
    Platform=WGS

We can run the NGS pipeline for the CYP2D6 gene:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pypgx run-ngs-pipeline \
    CYP2D6 \
    grch37-CYP2D6-pipeline \
    --variants grch37-variants.vcf.gz \

API examples
============

We can obtain allele function for the CYP2D6 gene:

.. code:: python3

    >>> import pypgx
    >>> pypgx.get_function('CYP2D6', '*1')
    'Normal Function'
    >>> pypgx.get_function('CYP2D6', '*4')
    'No Function'
    >>> pypgx.get_function('CYP2D6', '*22')
    'Uncertain Function'
    >>> pypgx.get_function('CYP2D6', '*140')
    'Unknown Function'

We can predict phenotype for the CYP2D6 gene based on two haplotype calls:

.. code:: python3

    >>> import pypgx
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*4', '*5')   # Both alleles have no function
    'Poor Metabolizer'
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*5', '*4')   # The order of alleles does not matter
    'Poor Metabolizer'
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*1', '*22')  # *22 has uncertain function
    'Indeterminate'
    >>> pypgx.predict_phenotype('CYP2D6', '*1', '*1x2') # Gene duplication
    'Ultrarapid Metabolizer'
